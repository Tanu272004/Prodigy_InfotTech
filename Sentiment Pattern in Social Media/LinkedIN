âœ¨ Task-04 Completed â€“ Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data âœ¨

As part of my internship with #ProdigyInfotech, I worked on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns from social media data ðŸ“Š.

ðŸ”Ž What I did in this project:

Cleaned and preprocessed social media dataset (handling missing values & columns).

Converted text data into numerical format using TF-IDF.

Built a Logistic Regression model to classify sentiments (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Irrelevant).

Evaluated performance with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score & Confusion Matrix.

Visualized sentiment distribution with a Pie Chart to understand public opinion.

ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings / Knowledge Gained:

How sentiment analysis works in real-world applications.

Importance of text preprocessing before ML.

Using TF-IDF to represent text numerically.

Understanding model evaluation metrics beyond accuracy.

How data visualization helps interpret public opinion clearly.

âœ… Model achieved ~70% accuracy, showing good capability to capture sentiment patterns!

Excited to keep learning and exploring more in this internship journey ðŸš€
