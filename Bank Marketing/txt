ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project from my internship at #ProdigyInfotech!

I worked on a Bank Marketing dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product based on their demographic and behavioral data.

Key steps I followed:

Data loading and exploration

Data preprocessing & converting categorical features

Feature-target split

Train-test split

Decision Tree model creation and training

Predictions on test data

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Identifying top features influencing customer decisions (like call duration and previous campaign outcome)

Drawing business insights from model predictions

ðŸ’¡ Knowledge Gained:

Understanding how Decision Trees work for classification problems

Learning to preprocess categorical and numeric data for ML models

Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Identifying key factors (features) that drive customer decisions

Practical exposure to data-driven decision making

Grateful for this learning experience at #ProdigyInfotech! ðŸ™Œ
